### Additional Resources and justification:
I am also converting available land into farmland in a 5-to-1 ratio, and then converting 1 farm to 1 food. This is justified by this source I found claiming that 5 or 6 acres of land is needed for someone to comfortable produce their own food. https://permaculturism.com/how-much-land-does-it-take-to-feed-one-person/#:~:text=A%20person%20needs%20about%205,comfortably%2C%20producing%20their%20own%20food.

I also am using military as a resource and am converting food, population, housing, and metallic alloys. Food is ina  3-to-1 ratio according to this stackexchange post https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/13081/how-many-resources-are-required-to-feed-1-million-soldiers, plus military will need places to sleep as well as metal for weapons, so these were factored in using 1-to-1 and 2-to-1 ratios respectively.
